# This is the data management script for the RF system.  For this system we do not want to
# automatically age out any data.  Since the waveform viewer is able to read gzipped files,
# we instead want to compress the data after 3 months.

# This data in this system is structured as ${SYS_DIR}/<location>/<date>/<timestamp>/<capture_files>
# The events are grouped so we need to gzip at the <timestamp> directory level for the viewer to
# be able to parse.  The system directory has a couple of ancillary directories that are not 
# locations, but all locations are CED style zone names (e.g., 1L23), so we can filter on that.
# Also make sure to not duplicate work if the directory has already been gzipped
# Note: -execdir says to run the command in the directory where the match was made.
# Note: subsequent -execdir commands are only run if the preceding -execdir command returns 0.
