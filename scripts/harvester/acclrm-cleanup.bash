# This is the data management script for the accelerometer system.  For this system we do not want
# to automatically age out any data.  Since the waveform viewer is able to read gzipped files, we
# instead want to compress the data after 3 months.

# This data in this system is structured as ${SYS_DIR}/<location>/<classification>/<date>/<capture_files>
# The events are ungrouped so we need to gzip at the <capture_file> level for the viewer to
# be able to parse.  The system directory might have a couple of ancillary directories that are not
# locations, but all locations are CED style zone names (e.g., 1L23), so we can filter on that.
# Also make sure to not duplicate work if the directory has already been gzipped
# Note: -execdir says to run the command in the directory where the match was made.
# Note: subsequent -execdir commands are only run if the preceding -execdir command returns 0.
